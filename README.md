# MercuryTool
Don't want to use Orion or IntelliJ?
Here is a small batch-skript helping you cloning and testing your PGdP-Submissions to correct them properly.

## Usage
Just copy the .bat file into your tests folder and execute it.
A Terminal-Window will clone a specific repo for you into the assignment folder or will run behavior tests on them.

You can even oben the assignment folder in Eclipse as an Java-Project (create new java-project > not the standard directory > choose assignment folder) and edit in it with all java helpers eclipse offers. And even if you use the tool to update the students solution to a new one you just have to refresh in eclipse and you have the next student. 

## Contribute
Use, test and report. 
I would be glad adding additional features or implementing more convenient ways of usage.
